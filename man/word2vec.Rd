\arguments{
\item{text}{Character string.}

\item{tokenizer}{Function, function to perform tokenization. Defaults to
\link[text2vec:space_tokenizer]{text2vec::space_tokenizer}.}

\item{dim}{dimension of the word vectors. Defaults to 50.}

\item{type}{the type of algorithm to use, either 'cbow' or 'skip-gram'. Defaults to 'cbow'}

\item{window}{skip length between words. Defaults to 5.}

\item{min_count}{integer indicating the number of time a word should occur to be considered as part of the training vocabulary. Defaults to 5.}

\item{loss}{Charcter, choice of loss function must be one of "ns" or "hs".
See detaulsfor more Defaults to "ns".}

\item{negative}{integer with the number of negative samples. Only used in case hs is set to FALSE}

\item{n_iter}{Integer, number of training iterations. Defaults to 5.}

\item{lr}{initial learning rate also known as alpha. Defaults to 0.05}

\item{sample}{threshold for occurrence of words. Defaults to 0.001}

\item{stopwords}{a character vector of stopwords to exclude from training}

\item{threads}{number of CPU threads to use. Defaults to 1.}

\item{collapse_character}{Character vector with length 1. Character used to
glue together tokens after tokenizing. See details for more information.
Defaults to \code{"\\t"}.}

\item{composition}{Character, Either "tibble", "matrix", or "data.frame" for
the format out the resulting word vectors.}
}
\value{
A \link[tibble:tibble-package]{tibble}, data.frame or matrix containing
the token in the first column and word vectors in the remaining columns.

\description{
Extract word vectors from word2vec word embedding
}
\details{
A trade-off have been made to allow for an arbitrary tokenizing function. The
text is first passed through the tokenizer. Then it is being collapsed back
together into strings using \code{collapse_character} as the seperater. You
need to pick \code{collapse_character} to be a character that will not appear
in any of the tokens after tokenizing is done. The default value is a "tab"
character. If you pick a character that is present in the tokens then those
words will be split.

The choice of loss functions are one of:
\itemize{
\item "ns" negative sampling
\item "hs" hierarchical softmax
}
}
\examples{
word2vec(fairy_tales)

# Custom tokenizer that splits on non-alphanumeric characters
word2vec(fairy_tales, tokenizer = function(x) strsplit(x, "[^[:alnum:]]+"))
